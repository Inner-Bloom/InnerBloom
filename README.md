## InnerBloom: A Comprehensive Wellness Tracker for Mental and Physical Health

InnerBloom is an intuitive and holistic wellness tracker designed to help individuals track and improve their mental and physical well-being. Tailored for those who want a structured, data-driven approach to their daily habits, InnerBloom empowers users to monitor key aspects of their life that impact overall health, including eating and sleeping habits, mood, thoughts, and feelings.

Unlike other mental health trackers, such as ‘How We Feel’, InnerBloom goes beyond basic mood tracking by incorporating qualitative data, allowing users to log and analyze their eating and sleeping habits in detail. This enables a more complete understanding of how daily activities and lifestyle choices influence emotional and mental health over time.


### Key Features:
- **Mood Tracking**: Track a wide range of emotions and feel free to log multiple moods each day.
- **Activity Log**: Record your daily habits including sleep, meals, exercise, and relationships.
- **Sleep Tracker**: Track sleep duration with 10-minute increments to understand sleep patterns.
- **Meal Tracker**: Log your meals and monitor their impact on your health and mood.
- **Exercise Tracker**: Record your physical activity to assess its effect on your mental well-being.
- **Relationship Tracker**: Reflect on your daily interactions with co-workers, family, friends, or when alone to understand how relationships impact your emotional state.
- **Data Insights**: Visualize trends in mood, sleep, and activity with graphs to identify patterns over time.
